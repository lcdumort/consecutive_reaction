# consecutive_reaction
## Introduction
A consecutive reaction is a chemical reaction of the form A => B => C. A forms B and B forms C. This is a first-order kinetic that is dependant of the beginning concentration of A and on the k1 and k2 values of the reactions. By using the matplotlib library, an visualisation of the concentration over time is given. The sliders, which come with the matplotlib library, give the possibility to interactivily see the influence of varying k1, k2 and beginconcentration of a on the concentrations of A, B and C.

## Requirements
Python3 should be installed on your computer.
Also matplotlib and numpy should be installed. This can be done with pip3.
```
sudo pip3 install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
Clone the repository to a folder and cd to it. Then use following command to start the program:
```
python3 consecutive_reaction.py
```
